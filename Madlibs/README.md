# MADLIBS

**Mad Libs** is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of *Mad Libs* books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.
