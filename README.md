This repository consists of these topics:
- **MADLIBS**: 
   - A game about prompting words into a secret story (or paragraph) before announcing the result.
   - This project covers the usage of string concatenation.
- **GUESS_NUMBER**:
   - A game about guessing number between user and computer.
   - This project uses:
      - Nested if-elif-else
      - try/except exceptions
- **ROCK_PAPER_SCISSORS**:
   - A traditional game where two players will choose one of the three objects (rock, paper, scissors), and compare to each other. (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
   - This project uses basic concept of defining functions, and string processing.
- **HANGMAN**:
   - A tranditional game where one player will think of a word, and the other players try to find it by guessing one letter at a time, within a limited number of guesses.
   - This project practices:
      - String manipulations (`upper()`, `len()`)
      - Set manipulations (`add()`, `remove()`, `join()`)
      - List comprehension
- **TIC_TAC_TOE**:
   - A traditional game where two players compete on a 3x3 grid, take turns fill in *X*s and *O*s. First player to successfully fill their characters 3 in a row, or 3 in a column, or 3 in a diagonal wins.
   - This project covers:
      - Class inheritances
      - Static methods in class
      - 2D manipulations (conditions related to rows and columns of the 3x3 grid)
      - Introduction to complex rules
- **TIC_TAC_TOE_MINIMAX**:
   - Re-do the *Tic_Tac_Toe* project from scratch, and adding Minimax bot (optimal player).
   - This project practices:
      - Minimax algorithm implementation (with recursive)
      - Fixing bugs
- **BINARY_SEARCH**:
   - Introduction to binary search algorithm.
   - This project covers:
      - Binary search algorithm implementation (with recursive)
      - `time()` function for tracking the duration of the algorithms
