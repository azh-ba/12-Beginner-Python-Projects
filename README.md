This repository consists of these topics:
- **MADLIBS**: 
   - A game about prompting words into a secret story (or paragraph) before announcing the result.
   - This project covers the usage of string concatenation.
- **GUESS_NUMBER**:
   - A game about guessing number between user and computer.
   - This project uses:
      - Nested if-elif-else
      - try/except exceptions
- **ROCK_PAPER_SCISSORS**:
   - A traditional game where two players will choose one of the three objects (rock, paper, scissors), and compare to each other. (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
   - This project uses basic concept of defining functions, and string processing.
- **HANGMAN**:
   - Another tranditional game where one player will think of a word, and the other players try to find it by guessing one letter at a time, within a limited number of guesses.
   - This project practices:
      - String manipulations (`upper()`, `len()`)
      - Set manipulations (`add()`, `remove()`, `join()`)
      - List comprehension
