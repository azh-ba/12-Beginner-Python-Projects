# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Rock paper scissors (commonly *scissors, paper, rock* or stone in Australia and New Zealand) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms on eof three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 

The earliest form of *rock, paper, scissors*-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern stanardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)
