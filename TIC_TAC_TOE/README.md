# TIC-TAC-TOE

**Tic-Tac-Toe** (noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with *X* and *O*. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assumming best play from both players.
