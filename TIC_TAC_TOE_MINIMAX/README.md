# TIC-TAC-TOE_MINIMAX

**Tic-Tac-Toe** (noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with *X* and *O*. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assumming best play from both players.

**Minimax** (minmax, mm, saddle point) is a decision rule used in artificial intellgence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin" - to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for several-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
